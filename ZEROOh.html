      <h2>About:</h2>

With millions of people suffering from hunger worldwide, it is essential to address the root causes and find sustainable solutions to eradicate hunger.It aims to end all forms of malnutrition and hunger by 2030 and ensure that everyone has sufficient food throughout the year, especially children.
